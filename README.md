# Conversion of Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) to Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)

A script written in python that converts a given .txt file describing a NFA to DFA. The file must be formated as follows:

| Line | Contains |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | number of states |
| 2 | alphabet |
| 3 | Initial state |
| 4 | Final state |
| rest | Transitions |

The input file must describe every state with the use of a **single** character (0, 1, A, B, q, r). The `âˆ…` symbol is represented with `_` in the output DFA.txt file.

The script also prints out a dictionary where the key is the state and the values are the result states for every symbol in the alphabet. For example for an alphabet containing two symbols, from state A the first symbol transitions to state AB and the second symbol transitions to state B the program would print: `{ 'A': ['AB', 'B'] }`.

Below are three examples of how to convert the graphical representation of a NFA to an acceptable input, note that there is no need for the comments in the input file.


### Example 1

`NFA.txt:`
```
3       // Number of states
01      // Alphabet
0       // Initial state
2       // Final state
001     // From state 0 with input 0 next state is 1
000     // From state 0 with input 0 next state is 0
010     // From state 0 with input 1 next state is 0
112     // From state 1 with input 1 next state is 2
```
`DFA.txt` output:
```
3		//Number of states
01		// 2 symbols in the alphabet
0		// Initial state(s)
02 		// Final state(s)
0 0 01		// From state 0 with input 0 next state is 01
0 1 0		// From state 0 with input 1 next state is 0
01 0 01		// From state 01 with input 0 next state is 01
01 1 02		// From state 01 with input 1 next state is 02
02 0 01		// From state 02 with input 0 next state is 01
02 1 0		// From state 02 with input 1 next state is 0
```

```

A 1 B		// From state A with input 1 next state is B
AB 0 AB		// From state AB with input 0 next state is AB
AB 1 AB		// From state AB with input 1 next state is AB
B 0 _		// From state B with input 0 next state is _
B 1 A		// From state B with input 1 next state is A
